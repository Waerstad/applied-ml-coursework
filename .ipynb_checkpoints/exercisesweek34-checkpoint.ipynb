We expect that many of you will encounter some trouble with setting these programs up, as they can be extremely finnicky and prone to not working the same on all machines, so we strongly encourage you to not get discouraged, and to show up to the group-sessions where we can help you along. The group sessions are also the best place to find group partners for the projects and to be challenged on your understanding of the material, which are both essential to doing well in this course. We strongly encourage you to form groups of 2-3 participants. \n",

The deadline for the weekly exercises is set to Fridays, at midnight."

    "**d)** Download the Github CLI tool and run ´gh auth login´ in your terminal to authenticate your local machine for some of the later steps. (https://github.com/cli/cli#installation). You might need to change file permissions to make it work, ask us or ChatGPT for help with these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e)**  As an alternative to the above terminal based instructions, you could install GitHub Desktop (see https://desktop.github.com/download/) or if you prefer GitLab, GitLab desktop (see https://about.gitlab.com/install/). This sets up all communications between your PC/Laptop and the repository. This allows you to combine exercises 1 and 2 in an easy way if you don't want to use terminarl. Keep in mind that these GUIs (graphical user interfaces) are not text editors."

A virtual environemnt is a folder in your project which contains a Python runtime executable as well as all the packages you are using in the current project. In this way, each of your projects has its required set of packages installed in the same folder, so that if anything goes wrong while managing your packages it only affects the one project, and if multiple projects require different versions of the same package, you don't need to worry about messing up old projects. Also, it's easy to just delete the folder and start over if anything goes wrong.\n",
